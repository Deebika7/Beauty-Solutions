<p>
	Similar to foundation, a good concealer helps hide any imperfections and give your skin a boost. Concealers may help reduce the appearance of dark circles or unsightly marks on your face.


<h3>Choosing A Concealer</h3>
If you’re never used a concealer before, be aware that different formulas and finishes offer different benefits or effects. Here’s a basic primer to guide you in selecting the one you may be looking for:



<h3>Liquid concealer(usually in a tube, with an applicator):</h3>
More lightweight and blendable, but pigmented enough to spot-conceal blemishes and go over wrinkled or crepey skin more smoothly. 
<h3>Cream concealer:</h3> Good for balancing out redness or discoloration on larger areas of the face. It’s best applied out of the pot or by using a stick or a sponge.
<h3>Brightening concealer:</h3> (either in cream or liquid): Formulated with more light-catching pigments, this concealer may help hide the appearance of dark circles underneath the eye area.
